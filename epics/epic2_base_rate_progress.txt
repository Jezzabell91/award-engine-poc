## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-22
**Task:** US-2.1 - Base Rate Lookup
**Actions Taken:**
- Created `src/calculation/mod.rs` module for calculation logic
- Created `src/calculation/base_rate.rs` with `get_base_rate` function
- Implemented `BaseRateLookupResult` struct with rate and audit step
- Added support for employee override rates (takes precedence)
- Added config lookup by classification code and effective date
- Returns `ClassificationNotFound` error for unknown classifications
- Returns `RateNotFound` error when no rate exists for the effective date
- Audit step records rule_id: 'base_rate_lookup', clause_ref: '14.2'
- Audit step input includes classification_code, output includes determined rate
- Added `Penalties` and `OvertimeSection` to config module exports
- Wrote tests for all 4 test cases (BR-001 through BR-004)
- All tests pass, clippy produces no warnings
**Result:** PASS
**Notes:** All acceptance criteria met. Function signature includes step_number parameter for proper audit trail sequencing.
**Commit:** (pending)
